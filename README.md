# LogisticRejectionSampler

This is a rejection sampler that takes a logistic sample from a logistic distribution and inverts the CDF by setting it equal to uniform draws between 0 and 1. This creates a logistic distribution. The code then finds the probability that the X value lies between 2 and 3 in the logistic distribution. It also plots the histogram of the logistic distribution.
